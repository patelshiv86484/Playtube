// This ApiError class is created to Standardize "API Error Handling" passing single type object to all api error.
// The built-in Error class in JavaScript only stores a message and stack trace.
// This ApiError class adds extra properties like statusCode, errors, data, and success to provide a consistent error response for API failures.


class ApiError extends Error{//this is created by extending error class because node internally rectifies error but can't response.

        statusCode,

        errors=[],
        stack="",//this capture the stack trace at the point where the error was created
    ){
        super(message);//this will do this.message=message
        this.statusCode=statusCode,
        this.errors=errors;

        else{
